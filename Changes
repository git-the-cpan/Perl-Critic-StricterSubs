     [Enhancements]
     * ProhibitCallsToUndeclaredSubs is now configurable to exempt specific
       packages and subroutines.  See docs for details.

     * Added support for blocks-of-constants in ProhibitCallsToUndeclaredSubs.
       For example: use constant {FOO => 1, BAR => 2);

     * RequireExplicitInclusion now considers all "include" statements.  So
       a conditional or lexical "require" will now satisfy the policy, even
       if that condition is never satisfied during run-time, or the package
       is included in the wrong scope.

     * Refactored common code into the StricterSubs::Utils module.

     * Eliminated certain flavors of false-positives in several Policies.

     * Improved caching gives performance boost when analyzing many files.

     * Documented diagnostic messages.

     * Now requires Perl-Critic-1.052+
